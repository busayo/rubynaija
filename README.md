Rubynaija is a web application developed with the Ruby on Rails Framework. I believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. 

Rubynaija is a repository of projects crafted with the Rails Framework by Nigerian Developers. 

Rubynaija aims to bring together Rails Developers across Nigeria and grow to become a hub for Nigerian Ruby on Rails Developers. A community where other Nigerian Developers see what their fellow counterparts in thesame country are working on and get to be able to contact them easily.
